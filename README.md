# Mind the Gap Difference between male and female developers
 

# Overview
Every Year Stack Overflow Publishes its developer survey. In this project. I used 2019 to analyze and find the difference between female and male developers.

The questions I was interested to answer:

- What proportion of participants is a woman group?
- What is the most popular Programming language among female and male developers?
- What type of developer they are? Do they code foe living or for fun?
- What is the age proportion between male and female groups?
- What are the top 10 countries the participants live in?
- What type of employment the respondents have?
- And, most importantly, what is the difference in their pay?
